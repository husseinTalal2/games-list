You play as Nancy Evans and it\u0027s up to you to investigate the strange phenomena coming from this gloomy house. According to Mary, it\u0027s haunted by ghosts. Indeed, her interest in mysticism has her thinking that the creaking that can be heard, the shadows wandering the halls, and the strange smell that sometimes prevails there are all supernatural in origin. Nancy explores the house and is amazed to discover that the spirits are trying to communicate with her, leaving messages for help in the world of the living. What exactly happened in this house to cause these spirits to be so unquiet?",

Years ago humans along with the Arlings used Polygon-4 for a number of military experiments, but later left the test complex. However, the intelligent machines, AIMs, continue to fulfill objectives they are programmed for: further evolution and self-perfection. AIMs of the Reckoners clan built a network of tracks to test multi-purpose combat machines in action. \n \nIf you are not afraid of awesome speed, fatal traps and plasma charges, tearing apart your racing glider’s sheeting, A.I.M. Racing is a game of your choice. There is no need to save money to buy a new glider, no need to think, where you can acquire energy supply for a more powerful canon. The clan will give you everything – but you must win!",

Cassia, a young woman of noble descent, has only one goal: She wants to claim the Shark Throne, no matter the price; and be it only for one day. Unfortunately, there are two problems that potentially foil her plans. First of all, she spends her days incarcerated in a dungeon and secondly, there is already a man on her throne: Marwan. She is neither fond nor proficient in matters of diplomacy or politics, so she chooses a more... practical approach. She intends to break out of prison and overthrow Marwan to claim the throne herself. For this, she needs strong allies. She needs to recruit an army of Sellswords and rally the Vanquishers of the Nine Hordes around her. Sounds like a solid plan, doesn\u0027t it? But then again, how cunning must one be to escape the dungeon\u0027s walls; and how reckless must one be to gather and command the worst scum of the realms?",

You are a budding entrepreneur, whose hotel is rather unfortunately located within the territory of Tarnation Tadstock, the Texas Tyrant. Your only defense against Tadstock’s army of seagulls, rats, yetis, and more is to build your hotel as quickly and intelligently as possible, using an array of increasingly sophisticated weapons. \n\nThe beautiful artwork, quirky storyline, and frantic gameplay all work seamlessly together with a generative music system, which creates original music depending on the player’s actions and decisions. The player becomes a composer, creating complex musical structures to defend their hotel. A vast variety of music can be generated, from delicate beach chillout to country banjo techno. \n\nGet the BAFTA-winning game that Kotaku said was \"wonderful\" and The Guardian called \"an unlikely work of minimalist art\".",

It is the second multiplayer-focused game in the Quake series after Quake III Arena. \n \nQuake Wars features similar gameplay to Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory, but with the addition of controllable vehicles and aircraft as well as multiple AI deployables,[13] asymmetric teams, much larger maps and the option of computer-controlled bot opponents. Unlike the previous Enemy Territory games, Quake Wars is a commercial release rather than a free download. \n \nEnemy Territory: Quake Wars received mostly positive reviews upon release, although it received some criticism on consoles.",

It\u0027s the ultimate spellcrafting sandbox. \n\nWhat makes it all possible is code. The game provides a coding interface where you can specify exactly what your spells will do. This interface is intuitive enough for individuals (young and old) who have never coded before. But skilled coders will also enjoy using their coding skills in new and creative ways! Even children can use this interface to make mountains out of the terrain, make an impenetrable force field around yourself, or even make a golem creature out of the surrounding rocks.

The game is a high speed auto-runner with a satisfying double-jump mechanic played in landscape mode with both hands. \n \nThe game features minimal, yet colourful aesthetics, with upbeat music and nice sound effects. There are no virtual controls visible on screen, instead the player taps on either side of the display to control the avatar. \n \nThe goal of the game is to pick up items while traversing the track to reach the finish line. The items picked up are used to unlock more tracks. Reaching the goal will require the avatar to jump over obstacles while at all times ensuring that the colour of the avatar matches the colour of the running surface. The latter mechanic is what makes this runner somewhat unique. Many of the tracks feature two or more paths to the goal, which increases the longevity of the game. \n \nFirst launch opens directly on the first track, which is used to teach how to switch colour mid-air while jumping to prevent the avatar from exploding. After the tutorial is completed, you are taken to the menu where the first track is unlocked. \n \nThe game consists of a series of grouped tracks which have to be unlocked by collecting enough chameleons - found along the tracks. The number of chameleons required to progress is shown on screen while in the menu. \n \nAs of writing the game is available to iOS, Android and Windows mobile phones, as well as tvOS (Apple TV).",

The real skill though is in knowing just what to shoot and when to shoot it and where some targets reap sizeable rewards others will drain your score in no time at all. One addition to version three is the introduction of protected birds flying around with your intended targets which means that shooting now takes a little more thought than simply blasting into the sky. Other features remain intact and there are still items that need to be avoided such as balloons and various animals on the ground. As usual though you\u0027ll need to experiment to find out just what\u0027s worth hitting and what\u0027s not. \n \nOne of the best parts of the Moorhen series has been the hidden bonuses and secrets but they\u0027ve always been well concealed and you\u0027re more likely to discover them by accident rather than actually work them out. I won\u0027t spoil some of the goodies we\u0027ve discovered in this version but Moorhuhn 2 featured spiders that could be spun around trees and the first edition had you shaking trees then shooting down ten leaves for a 100 point bonus. Finally the hi-score chart is still there as is the wonderful battery back up so you can prove that you did actually get a score over 50.",

    "summary": "A third-person open world survival horror action RPG set in a universe you\u0027ve never experienced before. Play as one of the Forsaken, the last frontier of humanity against the growing horrors of the Omnistructure. As you find yourself stranded in a faraway outpost, you must adapt in order to survive. The world won\u0027t wait for you though, you must venture into the unknown - your faith will decide your fate. \n \nFeel the burden of surviving in one of the last remaining outposts of the Forsaken, a legion of hunters condemned to protect the last vestige of humanity. The nature of your purpose however is shrouded in mystery, and as you delve deeper into the manifold halls of the Omnistructure, you will come to find the true meaning of alienation, isolation, and dread. A cross between cyberpunk, and dark fantasy - Bleak Faith will offer a story and experience that will be a breath of fresh air for all gamers looking for a something new. The world is full of lore, and every aspect of it is crafted with utmost passion and a dedication to art. As a baseline there is an estimated 30+ hours of content, a deep class system, and a procedural AI system that ensures that no playthrough is ever the same. \n \nThe architecture of the world, the Omnistructure, is a huge aspect of the game. Meticulously designed and crafted, Bleak Faith aims to provide an emergent narrative method coupled with more structured traditional moments. The world of Bleak Faith is labyrinthine, tapping into an innate curious instinct we all have when faced with many defined branching choices - we focus on creating a strong sense of curiosity about the path not taken, by offering unique and compelling content in every area of the world - having said that the world employs both vast open areas, and more linear openness in Metroidvania fashion. The aim is to evoke that same feeling of wonder and excitement that you felt the first time you played a game, the first time you experienced 3D graphics, the first time you experienced something that felt formative and not habitual. Open world in Bleak Faith is a crucial aspect to showing you the reality of the Forsaken. In this world there are few havens for the Forsaken, and these are generally outposts which serve as bases (of various complexities and utility) to recover from journeys and prepare for more - however, nowhere is truly safe! \n \nExpect tight and meticulously crafted and expanded combat that brings tempo and action to this world in amazing quality and detail. We\u0027re not shying away from a challenge, and so we\u0027re going all in. Despite being a small team, we couldn\u0027t accept a simple mundane combat system; we are making it fleshed out, and very robust. The combat communicates the danger in adrenaline-pumping fashion. Fast, responsive, and unforgiving - you will earn and feel every victory, nothing comes easy. Approach combat in your own way however - choose stealth over face-to-face combat, choose ranged over melee, choose Technomancy over more traditional combat styles. The system allows you to express yourself through combat, or through avoiding it - and that\u0027s further supported through a class system as well. \n \nHow better to experience the unyielding uncertainty of the Omnistructure than through a simulated ecosystem of factions and AI groups. Inhabitants of the Omnistructure will compete among themselves, grow and expand, change and adapt - the food chain in the ecosystem will, as a result, mold to every playthrough (e.g. an apex predator from your last playthrough might have already died out in this playthrough and you never fight it again). It\u0027s a constant race against time as enemies will try and outgrow and outsmart not only you, but other competition. Hunt, scavenge, and grow to stay on top of the food chain. Never experience an area the same way as the procedural nature of the ecosystem will ensure that you can never let your guard down. Having said that, there are still linear areas of the game, especially those that cover main plot points - to ensure a direction and purpose for the player. The ecosystem makes every moment of gameplay interesting and engaging - even on multiple playthroughs. \n \nFight against the odds, and stay alive despite the Omnistructure\u0027s evergrowing threat. Craft, scavenge, hunt, and find ways to excel. Pick a class, upgrade stats, augment your character, create equipment and stay healthy. Resist the Puppet Plague, and the many afflictions present in the world which can change the outcome of your journey entirely. Use stealth and your environment to your advantage - fighting is not always the best course of action, and when it is, preparing the field to shift the odds in your favor is a necessary tactic.",

It quickly endeared players with its fantastic atmospheric soundtrack, perilous locations to progress through, countless puzzles to solve, and more ways to gruesomely die than gamers previously thought possible. Thrust into the role of “The Seed of Prophecy”, players travel deep into the castle, in hopes of defeating the evil that dwells within – the dreaded Warlock Lord. \n \nThis game is a re-imagining of the original Shadowgate, released for Mac in 1987 and later ported to, for example, NES and Nintendo 64.",

Players control a spirited young ninja as they make their way through a diverse selection of indoor and outdoor locales. The title character is garbed in a blue suit and matching hooded mask, so that only his eyes and his expressive brow are visible to players. The character also wields a pair of katana blades in both hands as he jumps from platform to platform, avoiding hazards and slicing at enemies. The cartoon-style atmosphere is brought to life with the use of cel-shaded graphics, giving the game a distinctive look from many of its platform contemporaries. \n \n \nI-Ninja is an adrenaline-charged adventure game. An ultra-cool ninja with major attitude meets extreme sports game play, I-Ninja is the consummate warrior who has spent years mastering his weapons and honing his skills. In true gravity defying game play, I-Ninja can scale buildings, \"shred\" on extreme rails, hover great distances with a \"sword copter\", ride drifting roller spheres and utilize specialized manga-style ninja moves to navigate through each dynamic environment.",

The expansion allows for the creation of Starfleet player characters from the era of the original series who become involved in an ongoing \"Temporal Cold War\" (a storyline that was introduced in Enterprise, and brought into STO with the \"Future Proof\" missions in Season 11) with the Na\u0027kuhl species. Matt Winston reprised his role as Daniels, the temporal agent who fought alongside Captain Jonathan Archer to stop the Na\u0027kuhl in several episodes of Enterprise. He was also joined by Walter Koenig, reprising his role as Pavel Chekov, and Chris Doohan as Montgomery Scott, filling in for his late father, James Doohan. The expansion also intersects with the alternate timeline from the reboot series begun in 2009 by J. J. Abrams; Joseph Gatt reprises his role as the cyborg science officer 0718, who appeared in Star Trek Into Darkness",

You have aboard your ship no more than an handful of trusty followers and a limited supply of food and building materials. You are here to begin a new life. As you select which island to settle, your future is already sealed, for each one has its own special characteristics.\nYour goal is to create a whole new world. Explore, construct, settle, trade and defend - that is the challenge that lies before you!\n\nAnno 1602 takes you into the world of construction strategy games. Build a realistic, living world for yourself according to your own ideas; your chosen strategy will decide the development and destiny of your towns and villages. Prove your diplomatic skills in your dealings with natives, your comrades and pirates too. Start by building up farms, plantations and small workshops to produce, then use your business acumen and begin to generate trade with your fellow players.\nBut beware, for with riches and prosperity also comes envy and anger! Train soldiers and build defensive structures to protect your property and wealth, or perhaps it may be wise to put your negotiation skills to use outside of business?",

Along the way, she meets Marisa Kirisame, who joins Reimu, and Cirno, who attacks Reimu for making fun of her. Eventually, Cirno ends up joining Reimu\u0027s party due to unforeseen circumstances. \n \nOnce Reimu and her get to the Scarlet Devil\u0027s place, they find a great castle. Hong Meiling guards the gate to the castle. Reimu defeats her with relative ease. Reimu enters the castle, and runs into Sakuya Izayoi. Reimu asks where Remilia Scarlet is, and Sakuya says she is resting in her chambers. Sakuya then proceeds to \"take out the trash.\" Sakuya is defeated, but she warns that they are only reaching towards their death. As Reimu and the party move on, they meet Alice Margatroid, who is said to be there to play. Marisa doesn\u0027t believe this, as everyone knows Alice has no friends. They fight, and Alice loses. The three proceed to the arena part of the castle, and meet Suika Ibuki, who is there because she wanted to go somewhere other than the Hakurei Shrine for once. The party defeats Suika, and Suika says after this incident is solved, they should throw a party back at the shrine. \n \nIn the library, they meet Patchouli Knowledge, and defeat her. Reimu then proceeds up to the clock tower, where the moon begins to turn a scarlet color. On the top of the tower, they are intercepted by Sakuya once more. Sakuya is defeated again, but the heroines wonder what Remilia\u0027s plan is. Apparently, Sakuya does not know what Remilia is doing, and was only instructed to build the castle. Patchouli states that the last time Remilia was seen, she was looking through an ancient book. Reimu sees the potential dangers in this, and proceeds to the chamber. There, they are greeted by Remilia Scarlet. She says she was waiting for Reimu to show up. Remilia has built the castle, spread the scarlet mist, and lured Reimu and her party for her plan... \n \nTo excavate buried treasure. Remilia read in a book about a treasure that lies underneath a red castle, so she instructed her servants to build a red castle. She spread the scarlet mist because the treasure must be excavated during daytime, as she cannot work during daytime normally. She lured Reimu to the castle so they can help excavate the treasure. Before she follows up her plan, Reimu interrupts. She says the treasure is only a legend based on the \"Red Mountain Castle\" on Mt. Akagi, and the treasure doesn\u0027t exist. It\u0027s only a legend from the outside world. With the incident now solved, Reimu proceeds to leave. Just then, Remilia changes her plan, saying she lured them to the castle so they can fight under the scarlet moon. Reimu and Remilia battle. Remilia is defeated, but she orders Meiling, Patchouli, and Sakuya to attack them. After they are defeated once again, and Remilia once again fights Reimu. After much struggle, Reimu and her party is victorious. With the incident solved, they all have a party back in the Hakurei Shrine. \n \nA few days passed, and Reimu heads to the castle once again to ask why the castle hasn\u0027t been taken down. Along the way, she is attacked by Rumia. Reimu proceeds to the castle and asks questions, but Meiling refuse to answer. Sakuya says now isn\u0027t the time, as they are running across a problem. When she meets Patchouli, she states that it isn\u0027t Remilia\u0027s fault, but \"her.\" Reimu enters the basement of the castle, and she meets Flandre Scarlet, who is angry that once again she is ignored and everyone had a party without her. Flandre attacks Reimu out of spite. After a hard battle, Flandre is defeated, but the fighting has calmed her down.",

The front player steers the tractor of the truck sitting down, controlling the gas and brakes, while the rear player stands, and steers the tiller for the rear wheels, controlling the swing of the trailer. The cabinet also provides the players with bells and horns, although these have no use in the actual game.",

Lost Planet 3 reveals new truths about the foreboding planet and the colonial history of E.D.N. III.\n\nLost Planet 3 introduces Jim Peyton, a rig pilot who leaves Earth to take on a hazardous but lucrative contract on E.D.N. III. Working for Neo-Venus Construction (NEVEC) who are preparing the planet for colonization, Jim joins his fellow pioneers at the Coronis base and begins surveying the uncharted terrain and obtaining samples of the planet’s energy supply – Thermal Energy.\n\nWith NEVEC’s existing Thermal Energy reserve running low the fate of the Coronis mission depends on the natural source of the energy supply being located. Realizing that this is a great opportunity for a huge pay-off and early ticket home to his family, Jim braves the risk of the treacherous environment and threat of the indigenous Akrid.\n\nActing as a home away from home and boasting an array of tools that can assist Jim on the field, the utility rig provides Jim’s safety and is essential not only for his contract work but also his protection against the ever-changing climate.\n\nLost Planet 3 will deliver a diverse range of gameplay including on-foot battles and intense first person action. With a number of multiplayer modes and a compelling single player experience, Lost Planet 3 will delve deeper into the Lost Planet universe, uncovering hidden truths within the unique and dynamic environment of E.D.N. III.",

    "storyline": "It\u0027s the 41st Millennium. For 20,000 years mankind has expanded forth throughout the galaxy aided by a phenomenal invention known as the Warp Drive, which allows huge spatial distances to be traversed in a matter of hours. Under the auspices of the Emperor; a psychic so powerful he is essentially immortal, a pan-galactic Imperium has been established in which mankind has spread and prospered. The defenders of the Imperium are the Adeptus Astartes, or Space Marines, bio-genetically engineered warriors of superhuman prowess, ever vigilant to destroy the many threats that face mankind across the cosmos. \nThe player is one such Space Marine, belonging to one of the oldest and most honourable Chapters known as the Blood Angels, whose battle honours date back as long as the Imperium has existed. You have acquitted yourself well even among such heroic company, and it is thus that the player finds him/herself assigned to the Terminator company. Among the thousand warriors that compose a Space Marine Chapter, only the hundred most valorous and gifted brothers are deemed worthy enough of this honour. Terminators are the Chapter\u0027s ultimate warriors. Protected by this suit that makes them all but impervious to conventional weaponry, and armed with the most devastating weaponry available, Terminators stand in fear of no foe, no matter how potent. \nAmong the most insidious of mankind\u0027s enemies are Genestealers, a strange and terrifying alien race, reptilian in appearance, they are huge armoured six-limbed beasts, preternaturally swift and unbelievably ferocious in combat. A genestealer knows no fear, charging into combat irrespective of any threat to its life. Incredibly hard to kill and all too capable of inflicting death themselves, it is no surprise that Genestealers are considered one of the foremost threats to mankind\u0027s survival. However, there is another more frightening element to their nature: Genestealers are incapable of reproducing amongst themselves, and must rely on other races to expand their population. \nThe method they employ for this purpose is terrifying upon encountering a suitable host, such as a human being, a Genestealer will fix its piercing eyes upon it, mesmerising it much like a Terran snake does its prey. While the host is thus hypnotised, the Genestealer will extend its tongue, which contains a hollow, pointed tube known as the ovipositor in a gruesome parody of a kiss, depositing a small egg-like cell that contains the Genestealer\u0027s genetic profile. This cell behaves like a cancer, malignantly coursing through the host\u0027s system and altering its genetic profile. The victim shows little outward sign of the infection - in fact, he gains some of the \u0027Stealer\u0027s remarkable strength, resilience and longevity, becoming healthier than he was before. The effect is only really evident once the victim comes to reproduce. \nOnce they come to mate, the offspring of any victim is born as a Hybrid, a corrupt creature exhibiting characteristics of both Genestealer and host species. The Hybrid itself is equipped with an ovipositor, which it uses in a similar manner to its Purestrain parent. This cycle continues, with each new generation of Hybrid resembling the host species more closely. By the fourth generation, the offspring is barely detectable as alien save for a few give-away signs such as unnaturally sharp teeth and a purplish tinge to the skin. The offspring of this fourth generation is procreated in the conventional manner, and can result in either a Hybrid, a normal member of the host species or a Purestrain Genestealer, the only manner in which Purestrains can be produced. All the generations are linked in a psychic community, so Purestrains, Hybrids, and hosts all conceive of themselves as constituents of the same brood. \nThe manner in which Genestealers carry out their reproductive process is of exceptional danger to the Imperium, as whole planets can fall to the Genestealer threat; the affected humans look and act no different from normal, and the hosts are extremely secretive about the insidious curse they bear. Indeed the first an external agency may know about the presence of Genestealers is once a whole planet has been affected by the curse, requiring total cleansing and repopulation. Imperial authorities are thus extremely keen to terminate the Genestealer menace at source, before it has a chance to affect any nearby planet. \nThe prime manner in which Genestealer came into contact with humanity is through the use of Space Hulks. These are spaceships of human origin which have become lost in Warpspace, either through a malfunction of the ship\u0027s Warp Drive, or just as a consequence of travelling in a medium as uncertain as Warpspace. The human occupants having died, Genestealers and their Hybrid brood move in, settling down to hibernation until the drifting Space Hulk comes into contact with a species riper for infiltration and domination. \nSo thus, it is that whenever a Space Hulk is detected in the proximity of a human planet, the stalwart warriors of the Space Marines are detached to rid the Hulk of its Genestealer cargo, preventing any chance of another planet falling victim to the Genestealer curse. Such is the combat prowess of the Genestealer that only the Terminator squads have met with any success. That is the player\u0027s status and this is the player\u0027s mission: rid the galaxy of the Genestealer menace once and for all.",
    "summary": "Space Hulk: Vengeance of the Blood Angels is a mix of a First-Person-Shooter and a tactical fighting game. It is placed in the Warhammer 40k background of the Games Workshop table top games. It is the successor of the PC game Space Hulk from 1993 and it tells of the fight between the imperial Terminator Chapters and the Tyranid Gene Stealers. \n \nYou control up to ten Terminators. You give them orders in a tactical screen and/or take over one of them and then move in a 3D environment and fight the Gene Stealers just as in a First- Person-Shooter. So the game includes tactical planning and fighting in a good balance.",

You can give her antlers or a tail, use nature as a blueprint or strike out in weird new directions. Control Quozzle as she learns to swing through the trees, climb sheer cliffs, dance over rivers of lava, and even soar through the air on thermal winds. \n \nIncredipede was made by a small team headed by Colin Northway, author of Fantastic Contraption.

The objective of the game is to destroy both, asteroids and saucers. The triangular ship can rotate left and right, fire shots straight forward, and thrust forward. Once the ship begins moving in a direction, it will continue in that direction for a time without player intervention unless the player applies thrust in a different direction. The ship eventually comes to a stop when not thrusting. The player can also send the ship into hyperspace, causing it to disappear and reappear in a random location on the screen, at the risk of self-destructing or appearing on top of an asteroid.",

Custom-built, open-source relativistic graphics code allows the speed of light in the game to approach the player’s own maximum walking speed. Visual effects of special relativity gradually become apparent to the player, increasing the challenge of gameplay. These effects, rendered in realtime to vertex accuracy, include the Doppler effect (red- and blue-shifting of visible light, and the shifting of infrared and ultraviolet light into the visible spectrum); the searchlight effect (increased brightness in the direction of travel); time dilation (differences in the perceived passage of time from the player and the outside world); Lorentz transformation (warping of space at near-light speeds); and the runtime effect (the ability to see objects as they were in the past, due to the travel time of light). Players can choose to share their mastery and experience of the game through Twitter. A Slower Speed of Light combines accessible gameplay and a fantasy setting with theoretical and computational physics research to deliver an engaging and pedagogically rich experience.",

The game was delayed for release in 2004 because its original publisher, Acclaim, went bankrupt. Juice Games and Fund 4 Games retained ownership of the property and sold the game to THQ, who funded the project for a further six months of improvements. In early 2006, British software publisher Focus Multimedia re-released the PC version of Juiced at a new budget price as part of its \"Essential\" games series. The game offers different modes including career and arcade that present the player with challenges of increasing difficulty. The player can customize the car to suit their style and unlock new ones in arcade mode. The game features nitrous boosts, similar to that of other racing games. Juiced went to number one in the United Kingdom MCV sales charts and its first version sold 2.5 million units.",

    "storyline": "15 years after the events of the original Alien film, Amanda Ripley, daughter of Ellen Ripley, learns from Christopher Samuels, an android working for the Weyland-Yutani corporation, that the flight recorder of her mother\u0027s ship, the Nostromo, was recently located by the crew of a salvage vessel, the Anesidora. The flight recorder is being held aboard Sevastopol, a remote space station owned by the Seegson corporation, in orbit around the KG-348 gas giant. Samuels offers Ripley a place on the Weyland-Yutani team being sent to retrieve it so that she can have closure regarding the fate of her missing mother. Ripley, Samuels, and Weyland-Yutani executive Nina Taylor travel to Sevastopol on board the Torrens courier ship. The group arrives at Sevastopol to find the station damaged and its communications offline. They attempt to spacewalk over to the station to investigate, but their EVA line is severed by debris, and Ripley is separated from the others and forced to enter the station on her own. \n \nWhile exploring Sevastopol, Ripley finds the flight recorder of the Nostromo with no data and learns that the station is out of control due to a deadly alien creature lurking aboard. After regrouping with Samuels and Taylor, Ripley meets the station\u0027s Marshal, Waits, and his deputy, Ricardo. Waits explains that the alien was brought onto the station by Anesidora captain Henry Marlow, whose crew discovered the flight recorder near the LV-426 moon, where they also found a derelict ship previously found by the Nostromo crew and a nest of alien eggs contained within. While exploring the derelict, Marlow\u0027s wife was attacked by a facehugger. She was then brought aboard Sevastopol for emergency medical treatment, but died after a chestburster hatched from her. Waits convinces Ripley to contain the alien inside a remote module of the station. Although Ripley is successful, Waits ejects the module from the station with her still inside. As the module careens towards KG-348, Ripley space-jumps back to Sevastopol using a space suit. \n \nRipley makes her way back to confront Waits, but Ricardo reveals that the station\u0027s service androids abruptly started slaughtering the remaining crew, including Waits. Samuels attempts to interface with the station\u0027s controlling artificial intelligence, APOLLO, to cease the rampage. However, the systems\u0027s defensive countermeasures kill him shortly after he opens a path for Ripley into APOLLO\u0027s control core. There, Ripley discovers that Seegson had been trying to sell off Sevastopol to Weyland-Yutani, who instructed APOLLO to protect the alien at all costs. Ripley tells APOLLO that the creature is no longer aboard the station and demands to cease all activity, but the system refuses, stating that \"scheduled reactor scans are unverified\". At the reactor, Ripley discovers an alien nest and initiates a reactor purge to destroy it. Ripley learns from Ricardo that Taylor was sent to retrieve the alien and that she freed Marlow in exchange for the location of LV-426. However, Marlow double-crossed her and took her hostage aboard the Anesidora. \n \nAboard the Anesidora, Ripley discovers a message from her mother that was recorded after her initial report of the events on the Nostromo, thus finally giving Ripley closure. Marlow attempts to overload the fusion reactor of the Anesidora to destroy the station and ensure that no remaining alien creatures survive; Taylor kills him in attempt to reverse the process, but she herself is killed by the electric discharge, forcing Ripley to escape shortly before the Anesidora explodes. The explosion destroys Sevastopol\u0027s orbital stabilisers, causing the station to slowly drift into KG-348\u0027s atmosphere. Ripley and Ricardo contact the Torrens for extraction, but a facehugger latches on to Ricardo, forcing Ripley to leave him. After making her way outside to help the Torrens detach from the station, Ripley is surrounded by alien creatures and ultimately thrown into the ship by a blast. Aboard the Torrens, Ripley discovers that another alien has boarded the ship. When Ripley is cornered in the airlock, she ejects herself and the alien into space. Adrift in her space suit, Ripley is awakened by a searchlight.",

Under the weight of passing decades it\u0027s sunk into the ice, with each successive owner building new levels on top. Now the station is an unmapped labyrinth of history, littered with relics left by researchers and explorers stretching back in time the deeper one descends.  \n\nWhen the writer Kristopher Holmquist chose Carina Station as the setting for his new novel, he was struggling in obscurity, working in a tiny unheated New York apartment. After his death from a rare neurological disorder, the unfinished fragments were published on a whim... and became incredibly popular, with thousands, then millions of fans wanting to know how the story was meant to end, and what lay at the bottom, the lowest level, of the mysterious polar station.  \n\nThirty years into the future, a clever publisher, Tethys House, commissions an artificial intelligence \"simulacrum\" of Kristopher Holmquist, called KRIS. Charged with finishing the now-legendary novel, KRIS wrestles with self-doubt. Is he as good as his original? What has Tethys kept from him about his life, and death? And how was the unfinished story ever meant to end?",
    "summary": "The Ice-Bound Concordance is an award-winning indie game using combinatorial narrative technology, enhanced by a printed book unlocked through augmented reality. Inspired by the mysterious fiction of writers like Borges and books like House of Leaves, the story takes players deep into the frozen ruins of a sinking polar research base.\n\nWhen a digital simulation of a long-dead author is created to complete his final masterpiece, a story of explorers trapped in at the end of the world, the player must help by exploring hundreds of permutations of his famous stories. By conversing with the troubled A.I. and rearranging his fragmented book, players decide how (and if) his book should end. A logic-driven combinatorial narrative system allows the player\u0027s input to shape the story with far more fidelity than most story-based games.\n\nThe game works with the physical printed book \"The Ice-Bound Compendium.\" This full-color 80-page art book unlocks new levels and pieces of the A.I. writer\u0027s past. Seen through the iPad camera or laptop webcam, the book\u0027s pages come alive via augmented reality tech, with new layers of secrets inscribed onto its pages.",

All visited locations are added to map to move around town.",

    "storyline": "You take on the role of the Karmakeeper, the protector of the Karma, the life giving force in the worlds. You will travel between various realms, solving the conflicts of the Guardians. Who originally were burdened with the task of maintaining the flow of Karma in the worlds and maintaining the balance in the multi-verse. You will encounter these Guardians (voiced by the previously named rock artists) and learn about their side of each conflict. Through puzzling and platforming you have to bring the long lost Karmaflow back into these worlds, to drive out the unbalanced Karma that led to the destruction of the guardian spirits of these universes.\nBecause it\u0027s the Karmakeeper’s job to hear out both sides, you decide who you want to support and thus determine the fate of that world. The way players resolve the conflict on a world influences the overarching story and the game\u0027s conclusion at the same time.\n\nKarmaflow sets itself out from other contemporary titles in multiple ways, with the game’s massive emphasis on music being the most obvious. While other video games may treat sound and music design as a nice additional feature, in Karmaflow, music is everything to the game’s experience. The persistent rock opera singing guides the players on an epic journey that changes depending on their choices, which in turn affects the tone of the music heard.\nBasecamp Games will release its first title \"Karmaflow: The Rock Opera Videogame\" on PC and MAC on january 16, 2015.",
    "summary": "Karmaflow is a unique spin on the traditional gaming experience. In Karmaflow, the game’s story is presented entirely in the form of a rock opera, sung by some of the world’s most talented rock voices.\n\nKarmaflow: The Rock Opera Videogame is a puzzle platformer featuring music performed by various musicians. Simone Simons (Epica), Dani Filth (Cradle of Filth), Marc Hudson (Dragonforce), Tony Kakko (Sonata Artica) and Alissa White-Gluz (Arch Enemy) all have lent their vocal talents to Karmaflow, along with the Metropole Orkest (the world’s biggest – Grammy-award winning – professional pop and jazz orchestra) working on the game’s score.\n\nThe aesthetic of Karmaflow is inspired by games such as the Zelda-series, Journey and the darker tone of Darksiders. The first world starts out rather dark and mysterious, while the third world has got plenty of crimson and its character design is directly influenced by the culture and legends of the Tibetan people. The sung narrative itself will have real depth and cover fascinating themes such as balance and contradictions.",

Something went wrong, and all of the sudden the alien spaceship lost control. It is yet unknown what caused the crash. However, thanks to this accident the Earth has obtained its very own satellite - the Moon. Most of the aliens died in a crash and just a bunch of them, placed in suspended animation, survived. \n \nWith no one to reanimate them, these poor creatures were doomed to the eternal sleep though. It was a shot from a Russian navy cruiser Aurora main gun that signaled the beginning of the October Revolution of 1917. Drunken sailors missed the Tsar\u0027s Winter Palace and hit the Moon instead. This shot deactivated alien sleeping machines and awakened the rest of their crew. A short while after remaining aliens realized that there was only one hope for them to survive - invade Earth. \n \nWhile preparing the invasion, they accidentally discovered with their telescope a sign right in a middle of the largest continent. The sign with a few scratched words on it — «Backwoods is a Hub of the Earth». This shabby road sign was in a tiny godforsaken Russian village Backwoods. Of course alien commanders made a decision to begin the global invasion with capturing such an important strategic point with a mysterious name - Backwoods. Meanwhile, Russia was in a midst of Civil War and Bolsheviks were trying to clear this area of anti-communist forces. Both the front line and Ural River split the village Backwoods in two. \n \nOne part of the village was somehow controlled by the brave Red Army but some remnants of the cowardly Whites were still comfortably stationed on the other side. Both parties were pretty sick and tired of fighting each other and it seemed like they were settled here for a long time. No side had a significant advantage and the end of war a distinct possibility. If it weren\u0027t for aliens, the situation was not going to change soon...",

Different items have their own unique offensive or defensive abilities, resulting in a wide array of firing patterns depending on which items are attached, and where they are attached. Items also have various degrees of weight, so if Nitori has many heavy items attached to her, then her movement speed will be greatly impacted.",

If you think you have what it takes, give it your best shot.

    "summary": "Defense of the Ancients (DotA) is a multiplayer online battle arena mod for the video game Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos and its expansion, Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne, based on the \"Aeon of Strife\" map for StarCraft. The scenario objective is for each team to destroy the opponents\u0027 Ancient, heavily guarded structures at opposing corners of the map. Players use powerful units known as heroes, and are assisted by allied heroes and AI-controlled fighters. As in role-playing games, players level up their heroes and use gold to buy equipment during the mission. \n \nThe scenario was developed with the \"World Editor\" of Reign of Chaos, and was updated upon the release of its expansion, The Frozen Throne. There have been many variations of the original concept; the most popular being DotA Allstars, which eventually was simplified to DotA with the release of version 6.68. This specific scenario has been maintained by several authors during development, the latest of whom is the anonymous developer known as \"IceFrog\" who has developed the game since 2005. \n \nSince its original release, DotA has become a feature at several worldwide tournaments, including Blizzard Entertainment\u0027s BlizzCon and the Asian World Cyber Games, as well as the Cyberathlete Amateur and CyberEvolution leagues; in a 2008 article of video game industry website Gamasutra, the article\u0027s author claimed that DotA was probably \"the most popular and most-discussed free, non-supported game mod in the world\". DotA is largely attributed to being the most significant inspiration for the multiplayer online battle arena genre. Valve Corporation acquired the intellectual property rights to DotA to develop a stand-alone sequel, Dota 2, which was released in 2013.",
